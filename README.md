# BMW HealthKit
Hack the drive
BMW Healthkit is a toolkit that provides you information about the status of your bmw car.
It also provides information about the nearest electric charging station whenever the battery level goes below the 25% charge level.

We are targeting mainly people living in cities for whom the night charging at their own garage is not an option at all; so, we came up with the unlimited car charging service based on the flat monthly fee. Your car will get picked up, driven to the charge station and charged and dropped by your place presumably at night, so you will have a full charged car every morning.

Our app runs on iOS.
